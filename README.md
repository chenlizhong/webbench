# [Web Bench 1.5](http://home.tiscali.cz/~cz210552/webbench.html)

Web Bench is a very simple tool for benchmarking WWW or proxy servers. Uses `fork()` for simulating multiple clients and can use HTTP/0.9-HTTP/1.1 requests. This benchmark is not very realistic, but it can test if your HTTPD can really handle so many clients at once without taking your machine down.
